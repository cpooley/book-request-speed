This data is from book requests at a library. From November 2017 (and is ongoing), I kept note of the date when the books were requested, how many copies of the title, itâ€™s original position in the queue, and measured how quickly it moved through the queue. I obtained this information using an unused, personal account and requested books that I noticed to be popular, where people would ask how long it would take. I kept track of this information with print-outs, and screenshotting the account pages.
