## Overview

When library patrons request an item, they often ask how long it will take to get it? I thought it would be interesting to write an application, which could provide an estimate of when the client should expect to receive their request. It is not possible to give an accurate date considering the numerous factors (transit, weekends, holidays, various delays, missing items, etc.). So, I collected data from over 50 popular titles, and tracked their move through the queue from “request” to “on the hold shelf”.
